### Role in the Model
This is the “default” propagation mechanism for most terrestrial links when no strong anomalous effects are present. It represents propagation dominated by:
- Line-of-sight or near-line-of-sight conditions
- Knife-edge and spherical-Earth diffraction over terrain obstacles
- Multipath/focusing and clear-air fading
- Precipitation attenuation

### Key calculations performed
- Knife-edge diffraction loss (§3.12, Attachment A)
- Spherical-Earth diffraction (first-term and full)
- Bullington equivalent knife-edge for actual and smooth profiles
- Clear-air fading and enhancement statistics (Attachment B)
- Precipitation fading including melting-layer effects (Attachment C)

### Architectural implication (future Java)
A `NormalPropagationCalculator` will orchestrate:
- `DiffractionCalculator` (Attachment A)
- `ClearAirFadingCalculator` (Attachment B)
- `PrecipitationAttenuationCalculator` (Attachment C)

It produces a full inverse CDF of basic transmission loss for all percentage times 0–100 %, which is then fed into the final combiner (Attachment J).

This sub-model is active on virtually every path and forms the baseline against which anomalous mechanisms (ducting, troposcatter, sporadic-E) compete.
